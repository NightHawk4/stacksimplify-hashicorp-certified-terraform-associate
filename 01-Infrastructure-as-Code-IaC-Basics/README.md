# This is my first edit to a file before adding and committing then pushing the repo to the github.

# 01. Edit file.
# 02. Add file to git for monitoring/tracking using git add . or git add <filname>.
# 03. Use git commit to apply changes made. This sends tracked files to a staging area which will then be uploaded during the git push command.
# 04. Use git push to send all local repo changes up to the github cloud. 
# 05. Don't forget to add credentials before trying to update your github repository. otherwise you won't have permissions to change the github repo.
# 06. Best to use SSH keys in order to do this if possible.
